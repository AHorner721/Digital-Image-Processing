# Octave - Digital Image Processing
Learning digital image processing techniques using the open source software GNU Octave.

## Digital Image Processing (DIP) Overview
Digital image processing is a method used to perform operations on an image in order to extract or enhance useful information.

Three Steps to Image Processing: 
1.  Import image via acquisition tools
2.  Analyze and manipulate the image
3.  Output result: An image or report based on image analysis

Digital Processing Techniques:
- Pre-processing: 
   - Geometric operations
   - Color manipulation
- Enhancement: 
   - Noise reduction
   - Spatial filtering
   - Thresholding
- Information Extraction: Histogram, Data Analysis
