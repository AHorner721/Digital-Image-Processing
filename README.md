# Octave - Digital Image Processing
Learning digital image processing techniques using the open source software GNU Octave. (Summer Internship 2019)

## Digital Image Processing (DIP) Overview
Digital image processing is a method used to perform operations on an image in order to extract or enhance useful information.

Three Steps to Image Processing: 
1.  Import image via acquisition tools
2.  Image analysis and manipulation
3.  Output result: An image or report based on image analysis

Digital Processing Techniques:
- Pre-processing: 
   - Geometric operations
   - Color manipulation
- Enhancement: 
   - Noise reduction
   - Spatial filtering
   - Thresholding
- Information Extraction: 
   - Histograms
   - Data Analysis 

## DIP Programs Implemented

Power Spectra Density (PSD):
- Power Spectra Density measures the strength of frequency variations of an image. High frequencies are sharp variations in pixel intensity values and associated with contour lines in an image. Low frequencies generally represent the smooth regions of an image.

Mutual Information (MI):
- Mutual information measures corresponding intensity pixel values between two images. It is implemented using a joint histogram, which counts how many graytone match or correspondence occurs. Mutual information is useful for finding the amount of information one variable has in relation to another variable.
